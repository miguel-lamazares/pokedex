# 🧢 Pokédex - Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is my Pokédex project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, using the **PokéAPI** as the data source. The goal was to practice working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and create something that combines my love for Pokémon with web development.

## 🔍 Features

- Search by **Pokémon name** or **number**
- Displays **animated sprites from Generation V (Black/White)**
- Shows **name** and **ID** of the Pokémon
- Simple, retro-style interface inspired by the classic games

## 💡 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla)  
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
